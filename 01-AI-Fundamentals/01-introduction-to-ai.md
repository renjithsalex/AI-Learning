# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. AI manifests in a variety of forms, ranging from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated neural networks capable of complex pattern recognition.

## Types of AI

### Narrow (Weak) AI
- **Definition**: AI systems designed and trained for a specific task
- **Examples**: 
  - Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)
  - Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon)
  - Image recognition software
  - Spam filters
- **Limitations**: Cannot transfer learning to other tasks

### General (Strong) AI
- **Definition**: AI systems with human-like capabilities across various domains
- **Characteristics**:
  - Self-awareness
  - Abstract thinking
  - Transfer learning capabilities
  - Adaptive problem-solving
- **Status**: Currently theoretical, not yet achieved

## AI Approaches

### Symbolic AI (Rule-Based Systems)
- Uses symbols to represent knowledge and relationships
- Relies on explicit rules and logical operations
- Examples: Expert systems, decision trees
- Advantages: Interpretable, works well with structured problems
- Limitations: Struggles with uncertainty, requires manual knowledge encoding

### Machine Learning
- Systems that learn patterns from data without explicit programming
- Key paradigms:
  - Supervised learning: Learning from labeled examples
  - Unsupervised learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
  - Reinforcement learning: Learning through trial and error with rewards
- Examples: Classification, regression, clustering algorithms

### Deep Learning
- Subset of machine learning using artificial neural networks with multiple layers
- Capable of automatic feature extraction from raw data
- Excels at complex pattern recognition tasks
- Examples: Computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition
