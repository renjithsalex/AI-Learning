# Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge sources. RAG combines two key capabilities:

1. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from external knowledge sources
2. **Generation**: Using that information to generate accurate, contextually relevant responses

RAG addresses one of the fundamental limitations of LLMs: their inability to access information beyond their training data or reason with up-to-date, domain-specific knowledge. By augmenting LLMs with external knowledge, RAG systems can provide more accurate, factual, and useful responses.

## Why RAG Matters

### Key Benefits

1. **Reduced Hallucinations**: By grounding responses in retrieved information, RAG significantly reduces the tendency of LLMs to generate plausible but incorrect information.

2. **Access to Current Information**: RAG systems can incorporate information that was created after the LLM's training cutoff date.

3. **Domain Specialization**: RAG enables adaptation to specific domains without requiring full model fine-tuning.

4. **Transparency and Attribution**: Information sources can be cited, increasing trustworthiness and verifiability.

5. **Data Privacy**: Organizations can connect models to their private data without exposing it during training.

## Core Components of RAG Systems

### 1. Document Store and Processing

- **Document Collection**: Gathering documents from various sources (web pages, PDFs, databases, etc.)
- **Document Processing**: Cleaning, formatting, and structuring documents
- **Chunking**: Breaking documents into manageable pieces (paragraphs, sections, etc.)

### 2. Embedding Generation

- **Embedding Models**: Converting text chunks into vector representations (embeddings)
- **Dimensionality**: Typically 768-1536 dimensions per embedding
- **Semantic Capture**: Representing meaning rather than just keywords

### 3. Vector Database

- **Vector Storage**: Efficiently storing and indexing embeddings
- **Similarity Search**: Finding vectors that are semantically close to a query
- **Scaling Considerations**: Handling millions or billions of embeddings

### 4. Retrieval Process

- **Query Understanding**: Processing and embedding the user's query
- **Semantic Search**: Finding relevant information based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Relevance Ranking**: Ordering retrieved information by relevance

### 5. Response Generation

- **Context Integration**: Combining retrieved information with the user query
- **Prompt Construction**: Crafting effective prompts that include retrieved information
- **LLM Response**: Generating a response that incorporates the retrieved information

## RAG Architectures

### Basic RAG

1. User submits a query
2. Query is converted to an embedding
3. Similar documents are retrieved from the vector database
4. Retrieved documents and query are combined in a prompt
5. LLM generates a response based on the provided context

### Advanced RAG Variations

1. **Multi-step RAG**:
   - Initial query → retrieval → refined query → retrieval → response
   - Allows for progressive refinement of information needs

2. **Hybrid Search**:
   - Combines semantic search with keyword-based search
   - Balances meaning-based and lexical matching

3. **Re-ranking**:
   - Initial broad retrieval followed by more sophisticated relevance scoring
   - May use a separate model to assess relevance

4. **Query Decomposition**:
   - Breaking complex queries into simpler sub-queries
   - Retrieving information for each sub-query separately

## Building a Simple RAG System

### Step 1: Document Processing

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

def process_document(document):
    # Split document into chunks (here using sentences as a simple approach)
    sentences = sent_tokenize(document)
    
    # Create chunks of approximately 3-5 sentences
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_length = 0
    
    for sentence in sentences:
        current_chunk.append(sentence)
        current_length += len(sentence)
        
        if current_length >= 500:  # Target chunk size
            chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = []
            current_length = 0
    
    # Add the last chunk if it's not empty
    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))
        
    return chunks
```

### Step 2: Generate Embeddings

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

def generate_embeddings(chunks):
    # Load a pre-trained embedding model
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    
    # Generate embeddings for all chunks
    embeddings = model.encode(chunks)
    
    return embeddings
```

### Step 3: Store in Vector Database

```python
import pinecone

def store_embeddings(chunks, embeddings, index_name):
    # Initialize Pinecone
    pinecone.init(api_key="your-api-key")
    
    # Create index if it doesn't exist
    if index_name not in pinecone.list_indexes():
        pinecone.create_index(name=index_name, dimension=embeddings[0].shape[0])
    
    # Connect to the index
    index = pinecone.Index(index_name)
    
    # Upload embeddings with their corresponding text chunks
    batch_size = 100
    for i in range(0, len(chunks), batch_size):
        i_end = min(i + batch_size, len(chunks))
        ids = [str(j) for j in range(i, i_end)]
        texts = chunks[i:i_end]
        embeds = embeddings[i:i_end].tolist()
        
        # Create records with metadata
        records = zip(ids, embeds, [{"text": text} for text in texts])
        index.upsert(vectors=list(records))
```

### Step 4: Retrieval and Response Generation

```python
import openai

def retrieve_and_respond(query, index_name, top_k=3):
    # Initialize embedding model
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    
    # Generate embedding for the query
    query_embedding = model.encode([query])[0].tolist()
    
    # Connect to Pinecone index
    index = pinecone.Index(index_name)
    
    # Retrieve similar documents
    results = index.query(vector=query_embedding, top_k=top_k, include_metadata=True)
    
    # Extract the text from the retrieved documents
    retrieved_texts = [result['metadata']['text'] for result in results['matches']]
    
    # Combine retrieved texts
    context = "\n\n".join(retrieved_texts)
    
    # Create prompt with context
    prompt = f"""
    Answer the question based on the following context:
    
    Context:
    {context}
    
    Question: {query}
    
    Answer:
    """
    
    # Generate response using OpenAI
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ]
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message['content']
```

## Evaluating RAG Systems

### Key Metrics
