## Getting Started

1. Choose a project that matches your current skill level
2. Use the prompts from the main ai-learning-content-prompts.md file to generate project guides
3. Create a new directory for each project you implement
4. Document your process and results

## Project Structure Recommendation

For each project, consider creating:

1. A README.md with project overview, goals, and instructions
2. A requirements.txt or package.json for dependencies
3. Source code organized in logical modules
4. Example inputs and outputs
5. Evaluation metrics and results

## Learning Approach

Projects are the best way to consolidate your learning. Start with simpler projects and progressively tackle more complex ones as your understanding grows.
