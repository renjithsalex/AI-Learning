# Introduction to AI Agents

## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike basic LLM applications that simply respond to prompts, AI agents are designed to be persistent, purposeful, and capable of interacting with their environment through tools and APIs.

An AI agent typically consists of:

1. **Perception**: The ability to receive and interpret inputs from the environment
2. **Memory**: Storage and retrieval of information over time
3. **Reasoning**: Processing information to make decisions
4. **Planning**: Formulating sequences of actions to achieve goals
5. **Action**: Executing decisions through tools or interfaces
6. **Learning**: Improving performance based on experience

## The Evolution of AI Agents

### From Simple Bots to LLM-Based Agents

1. **Rule-Based Agents (1960s-1990s)**
   - Based on explicit if-then rules
   - Limited to predefined scenarios
   - Examples: Expert systems, simple chatbots

2. **Machine Learning Agents (2000s-2010s)**
   - Trained on data to recognize patterns
   - Improved adaptability to new situations
   - Examples: Recommendation systems, game-playing agents

3. **Foundation Model Agents (2020s-Present)**
   - Based on large language or multimodal models
   - Capable of complex reasoning and natural interactions
   - Can use tools and follow instructions
   - Examples: AI assistants, autonomous researchers, coding agents

## Core Components of Modern AI Agents

### 1. Foundation Models

The "brain" of the agent, typically a large language model (LLM) or multimodal model that provides:
- Natural language understanding and generation
- Reasoning capabilities
- Task decomposition
- Instruction following

### 2. Memory Systems

Enables persistence and learning across interactions:
- **Short-term memory**: Current conversation context
- **Long-term memory**: Stored facts, preferences, and experiences
- **Working memory**: Temporary storage for active reasoning
- **Episodic memory**: Record of past interactions and outcomes

### 3. Planning and Reasoning Modules

Helps the agent decide what to do next:
- Goal decomposition
- Task prioritization
- Anticipating outcomes
- Sequential thinking
- Chain-of-thought reasoning

### 4. Tool Use Capabilities

Allows the agent to interact with the digital world:
- API integration
- Web browsing
- Code execution
- File manipulation
- Database access

### 5. Learning Mechanisms

Enables improvement over time:
- Feedback incorporation
- Behavior adjustment
- Knowledge accumulation
- Preference learning

## Agent Architectures

### 1. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

Combines chain-of-thought reasoning with action taking:
1. **Thought**: Agent reasons about the current situation
2. **Action**: Agent selects and executes an action
3. **Observation**: Agent observes the result
4. Repeat until goal is achieved

### 2. Reflexion

Incorporates self-reflection to improve performance:
1. Agent performs a task
2. Agent reflects on its performance
3. Agent identifies improvements
4. Agent applies learnings to future tasks

### 3. Plan-and-Solve

Emphasizes explicit planning before execution:
1. Understand the task
2. Create a detailed plan
3. Execute plan steps sequentially
4. Monitor progress and adjust as needed

### 4. Multi-Agent Systems

Multiple specialized agents collaborating:
- **Roles**: Different agents handle different aspects of a task
- **Communication**: Agents share information and coordinate
- **Evaluation**: Agents can critique and improve each other's work
- **Consensus**: Agents can vote or debate to reach better decisions

## Building a Simple AI Agent

### Example: Research Assistant Agent

Below is a simplified implementation of a research agent using Python, LangChain, and OpenAI:

```python
from langchain.agents import Tool, AgentExecutor, create_react_agent
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Set up the tools
search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()

tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search_tool.run,
        description="Useful for searching the internet to find information on recent events or topics."
    )
]

# Set up the memory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)

# Set up the LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4")

# Create the agent prompt
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
You are a research assistant agent. Your goal is to provide accurate and helpful information.
You can use tools to look up information you don't know.

Chat History:
{chat_history}

Question: {input}

Think through this step by step:
""")

# Create the agent
agent_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(
    agent=agent,
    tools=tools,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True
)

# Run the agent
def run_agent(query):
    response = agent_executor.run(input=query)
    return response

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        user_input = input("Ask the research agent: ")
        if user_input.lower() == "exit":
            break
        response = run_agent(user_input)
        print(f"Agent: {response}")
```
