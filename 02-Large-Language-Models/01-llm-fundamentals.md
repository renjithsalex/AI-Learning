# Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)

## What are Large Language Models?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence system trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. These models are "large" in two key aspects:

1. **Architecture size**: They contain billions or even trillions of parameters
2. **Training data**: They're trained on massive text corpora, often hundreds of billions of tokens

LLMs represent a significant advancement in natural language processing, enabling systems to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, understand complex instructions, and perform a wide range of language-related tasks.

## How LLMs Work

### Transformer Architecture

LLMs are based on the transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" (2017). Key components include:

- **Self-attention mechanisms**: Allow the model to weigh the importance of different words in relation to each other
- **Positional encoding**: Helps the model understand word order
- **Feed-forward networks**: Process the attention outputs
- **Layer normalization**: Stabilizes the learning process
- **Residual connections**: Help with training deep networks

### The Training Process

1. **Pre-training**: Learning general language patterns from vast amounts of text
   - Next token prediction: Learning to predict the next word given previous words
   - Masked language modeling: Predicting missing words in a sentence

2. **Fine-tuning** (optional): Adapting the model to specific tasks or domains
   - Supervised fine-tuning (SFT): Training on examples of desired outputs
   - Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): Refining outputs based on human preferences

### Tokenization

Before processing text, LLMs convert words into tokens:
- Words are split into subword units
- Each token is assigned a numerical ID
- Common words might be a single token
- Rare words might be split into multiple tokens

### Embeddings

Tokens are converted into high-dimensional vector representations:
- Capture semantic meaning
- Similar words have similar embeddings
- Allow mathematical operations on language

## Learning Exercise

1. Experiment with different prompts to an accessible LLM and observe how changes in the prompt affect the output
2. Compare responses from different LLMs (if available) to the same query
3. Identify a case where an LLM hallucinates and design a prompt to reduce this issue
