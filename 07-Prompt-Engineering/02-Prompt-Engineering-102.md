## Introduction

Prompt engineering is the art and science of effectively communicating with Large Language Models (LLMs) to obtain desired outputs. As AI technologies advance, the ability to craft precise, effective prompts has become a crucial skill for developers, researchers, and AI practitioners.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of prompt engineering techniques, from basic concepts to advanced strategies, drawing on insights from the Google Gen AI Intensive course and industry best practices.

## Fundamental Concepts

### What Makes a Good Prompt?

A well-crafted prompt should be:

- **Clear and specific**: Define exactly what you want
- **Contextually rich**: Provide necessary background information
- **Properly structured**: Organize information in a logical flow
- **Appropriately constrained**: Set boundaries for the response
- **Iteratively refined**: Improved through experimentation

### The Anatomy of Effective Prompts

```
ROLE: You are an expert in [specific domain]
TASK: Your job is to [specific task]
FORMAT: Please structure your response as [desired format]
CONSTRAINTS: Limit your answer to [specific constraints]
CONTEXT: Consider the following information: [relevant context]
QUERY: [Specific question or request]
```

## Prompt Design Patterns

### Zero-Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompts describe requests directly without examples:

```python
prompt = """When I was 4 years old, my partner was 3 times my age. Now,
I am 20 years old. How old is my partner? Let's think step by step."""

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    contents=prompt)
```

### Few-Shot Learning with Examples

Provide examples to guide the model:

```python
prompt = """
Classify the sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative:

Text: "The service was terrible and the food was cold."
Sentiment: Negative

Text: "I enjoyed the movie, but the popcorn was stale."
Sentiment: Mixed

Text: "The concert was absolutely phenomenal!"
Sentiment: 
"""
```

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Guide the model to show its reasoning process:

```python
prompt = """
Solve the following problem step-by-step:
If a train travels 120 km in 1.5 hours, what is its average speed in km/h?
"""
```

### Additional Patterns

- **Persona-Based Prompting**  
  Assign a detailed persona to shape style and tone.  
  Example:  
  ``` 
  ROLE: You are a scientific journalist specializing in AI ethics.
  TASK: Write a 200-word summary of the ethical considerations of LLMs.
  ```
  Pros: Richer voice. Cons: Risk of over-specification.

- **Instruction vs. Question Framing**  
  Instructions („List the top 5…“) often yield bullet outputs; questions („What are the top 5…?“) can be more conversational.

- **Multi-Turn Context Preservation**  
  Use delimiters to maintain history across turns:  
  ```
  CONTEXT:
  <history>
  {previous Q&A}
  </history>
  QUERY: Please continue from above…
  ```

- **Self-Ask and Decompose**  
  Prompt the model to break complex queries into sub-questions and answer sequentially:  
  ```
  “Decompose the problem into sub-tasks, answer each, then combine the results.”
  ```

- **Role-Instruction Hybrid**  
  Merge role-play with explicit steps:  
  ```
  YOU: You are a product manager.
  STEPS: 1) Identify user needs. 2) Propose features.
  ```

## Structured Output Generation

### JSON Response Formatting

```python
structured_output_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(
    response_mime_type="application/json",
    response_schema=SummaryRating,
)
response = chat.send_message(
    message="Convert the final score.",
    config=structured_output_config,
)
structured_eval = response.parsed
```

### Table Generation

```python
prompt = """
Create a comparison table between PyTorch and TensorFlow with the following criteria:
- Learning curve
- Production deployment
- Community support
- Debugging ease
- Mobile deployment
Format as a markdown table.
"""
```

### XML Formatting

```xml
<response>
  <summary>Short summary here</summary>
  <details>
    <point>Key advantage</point>
    <point>Key limitation</point>
  </details>
</response>
```

### YAML Formatting

```yaml
summary: "Short summary here"
details:
  - "Key advantage"
  - "Key limitation"
```

### CSV Output

```csv
Feature,Description
Performance,High inference speed
Accuracy,>95% on benchmarks
```

### Defining Schemas

- When using a JSON schema, clearly specify field names, types, and constraints in the prompt or via your `response_schema`.  
- Example prompt snippet:  
  ```
  FORMAT: Respond in JSON with keys "title" (string), "rating" (integer 1–5), and "tags" (list of strings).
  ```

## Advanced Techniques

### Context Window Management

Optimize the use of token context with strategic information placement:

1. **Critical information first**: Place the most important details at the beginning
2. **Relevant context only**: Include only what's necessary for the task
3. **Strategic truncation**: When dealing with large documents, use summarization or chunking

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG combines the power of retrieval systems with generative models:

```python
def get_rag_response(query, n_results=2):
    """
    Implement RAG to answer customer support queries:
    1. Retrieve relevant documents
    2. Combine with the query to create a prompt
    3. Generate a response using Gemini
    """
    # Convert query to embedding and find similar documents
    relevant_docs = db.similarity_search(query, k=n_results)
    
    # Format context from retrieved documents
    context = "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in relevant_docs])
    
    # Create prompt with query and context
    prompt = f"""
    Answer the following question based on the provided context.
    If you cannot answer from the context, say "I don't have enough information."
    
    CONTEXT:
    {context}
    
    QUESTION:
    {query}
    """
    
    # Generate response
    response = gemini_model.generate_content(prompt)
    return response.text
```

### Model Temperature Control

Temperature affects output randomness and creativity:

```python
# Creative, more diverse responses
creative_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(temperature=0.9)

# Precise, deterministic responses 
precise_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(temperature=0.1)

# Completely deterministic
greedy_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(temperature=0.0)
```

## Evaluation Methods

### Rubric-Based Assessment

```python
class SummaryRating(enum.Enum):
  EXCELLENT = '5'
  GOOD      = '4'
  AVERAGE   = '3'
  POOR      = '2'
  FAIL      = '1'
```

```python
def eval_summary(prompt, ai_response):
  """Evaluate the generated summary against the prompt used."""
  chat = client.chats.create(model='gemini-2.0-flash')

  # Generate the full text response
  response = chat.send_message(
      message=SUMMARY_PROMPT.format(prompt=prompt, response=ai_response)
  )
  verbose_eval = response.text

  # Get structured evaluation
  structured_output_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(
      response_mime_type="application/json",
      response_schema=SummaryRating,
  )
  response = chat.send_message(
      message="Convert the final score.",
      config=structured_output_config,
  )
  structured_eval = response.parsed

  return verbose_eval, structured_eval
```

#### What is Rubric-Based Assessment?
- A systematic method using predefined criteria and scales to evaluate AI outputs.
- Each criterion (e.g., relevance, clarity, factuality) is scored on a consistent scale.

#### Steps to Create a Rubric:
1. Define criteria (e.g., Accuracy, Completeness, Style).  
2. Assign a scale (e.g., 1–5) and weight for each.  
3. Provide descriptions for each score level.  
4. Combine into a JSON or table for structured evaluation.

#### Example Rubric Structure

```json
{
  "criteria": [
    {"name":"Accuracy","scale":5,"description":["Incorrect","Partially correct", "...","Fully correct"]},
    {"name":"Clarity","scale":5,"description":["Unclear","Somewhat unclear", "...","Crystal clear"]},
    {"name":"Completeness","scale":5,"description":["Missing key points","Partially complete", "...","Comprehensive"]}
  ]
}
```

#### Using Rubrics in Prompts
```
EVALUATION_RUBRIC: Use the JSON rubric above.  
TASK: Evaluate the AI summary and assign scores for each criterion.
```

### Comparative Evaluation

Compare outputs from different prompts to determine effectiveness:

```python
def compare_prompts(prompt_a, prompt_b, test_questions):
    """Compare the effectiveness of two different prompts."""
    results = []
    
    for question in test_questions:
        response_a = generate_response(prompt_a, question)
        response_b = generate_response(prompt_b, question)
        
        # Use an LLM to evaluate which response is better
        evaluation = evaluate_responses(question, response_a, response_b)
        results.append(evaluation)
    
    # Analyze the comparison results
    return analyze_results(results)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple and Iterate

Begin with straightforward prompts and refine based on outputs:

```
Initial: "Write about climate change."
Refined: "Write a 300-word explanation of how climate change affects marine ecosystems, focusing on coral reefs and using accessible language for high school students."
```

### 2. Use System and User Roles

```python
system_prompt = "You are an expert science communicator who specializes in explaining complex topics to children ages 8-12."
user_prompt = "Explain how vaccines work."
```

### 3. Include Format Instructions

```
FORMAT: Your response should be structured as follows:
1. A simple definition (1-2 sentences)
2. Three key points (1 paragraph each)
3. A real-world example
4. A brief conclusion
```

### 4. Provide Clear Evaluation Criteria

```
EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Scientific accuracy: All information must be factually correct
- Age-appropriate language: Use vocabulary suitable for 8-12 year olds
- Engagement: Include at least one analogy and one question to maintain interest
- Completeness: Cover how vaccines train the immune system
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Code Generation

```python
code_prompt = """
Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number. No explanation, provide only the code.
"""

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    contents=code_prompt)
```

Output:
```python
def factorial(n):
  """Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return n * factorial(n-1)
```

### Example 2: Data Analysis Prompt

```python
analysis_prompt = """
I have data on medal counts for the 2024 Olympics. Generate Python code using seaborn to create a visualization that shows:
1. The top 10 countries by total medal count
2. A breakdown of gold, silver, and bronze medals for each country
3. Clear labels and a title explaining the chart's purpose
"""
```

### Example 3: Implementing RAG for Customer Support

```python
def build_rag_chatbot():
    """
    Implement a RAG-based customer support chatbot that:
    1. Indexes product documentation
    2. Retrieves relevant information based on customer queries
    3. Generates helpful, accurate responses with source attribution
    """
    # Index product documentation
    documents = load_documents("product_docs/")
    chunks = split_documents(documents)
    embeddings = embed_chunks(chunks)
    db = create_vector_store(embeddings)
    
    # Define query processing function
    def answer_query(query):
        relevant_docs = db.similarity_search(query, k=2)
        context = format_context(relevant_docs)
        
        prompt = f"""
        You are a helpful customer support assistant.
        Answer the following question based ONLY on the provided context.
        If you cannot answer from the context, politely explain you don't have that information.
        Always maintain a professional, helpful tone.
        
        CONTEXT:
        {context}
        
        QUESTION:
        {query}
        """
        
        response = generate_response(prompt)
        return response, relevant_docs
    
    return answer_query
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Handling Hallucinations

Hallucinations occur when models generate information that appears plausible but is factually incorrect or fabricated.

#### Prevention Strategies:

1. **Explicit Instructions**: Direct the model not to speculate
   ```
   CONSTRAINT: Only use information from the provided context. If you don't know or are uncertain, say "I don't have enough information."
   ```

2. **Source Attribution**: Ask the model to cite its sources
   ```
   FORMAT: For each claim in your response, indicate the source (document name, page number) or state that it's a general explanation not tied to a specific source.
   ```

3. **RAG Implementation**: Provide authoritative information in the context

#### Detection Methods:

1. **Consistency Checking**: Compare outputs across multiple runs
2. **External Verification**: Validate key facts against trusted sources
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Ask the model to rate its confidence in each statement

### Handling Sensitive Topics

When models refuse to respond due to safety filters:

1. **Clarify Intent**: Explain the legitimate purpose behind your request
2. **Reframe Questions**: Ask for educational information rather than "how to" guides
3. **Use Professional Terminology**: Frame requests using academic or professional language

Example:
```
CONTEXT: I am a cybersecurity professional creating educational material for a company training session.
TASK: Explain common password vulnerabilities and how they are exploited, focusing on educational awareness rather than actual attack methods.
```

### Overcoming Length Limitations

1. **Chunking Strategy**: Break long tasks into smaller, manageable requests
   ```
   INSTRUCTION: This is part 1 of 3. Generate the introduction and first section only.
   ```

2. **Summarization**: Request condensed answers when hitting limits
   ```
   CONSTRAINT: If you find you're reaching the response limit, summarize remaining points briefly rather than cutting off mid-response.
   ```

3. **Format Optimization**: Use concise formats like bullets, tables, or lists

### Refining Unstructured Outputs

When responses lack structure or formatting:

1. **Format Templates**: Provide explicit templates
   ```
   FORMAT TEMPLATE:
   # [Title]
   ## Summary
   [1-2 sentence summary]
   ## Key Points
   1. [Point 1]
   2. [Point 2]
   3. [Point 3]
   ## Conclusion
   [Brief conclusion]
   ```

2. **Staged Generation**: Request formatting as a second step
   ```
   FOLLOW-UP: Please reformat your response as a structured markdown document with headings, bullet points, and code blocks.
   ```

**Technical Components**:
```python
# Sample RAG Implementation Structure
def build_simple_rag():
    # 1. Document Loading
    loader = DirectoryLoader("./data/")
    documents = loader.load()
    
    # 2. Text Splitting
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter()
    chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    
    # 3. Embedding
    embedding_model = SentenceTransformerEmbeddings()
    
    # 4. Vector Store
    vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(chunks, embedding_model)
    
    # 5. Retriever
    retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
    
    # 6. Generation with Context
    def generate_answer(query):
        docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
        context = "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])
        
        prompt = f"""
        Answer the following question based only on the provided context:
        
        Context:
        {context}
        
        Question:
        {query}
        """
        
        response = llm.predict(prompt)
        return response, docs
    
    return generate_answer
```

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Financial Report Analysis

**Business Challenge**: Analyze quarterly financial reports to extract key insights.

**Prompt Evolution**:

Initial Prompt:
```
Analyze this financial report and give me the highlights.
```

Refined Prompt:
```
ROLE: You are a financial analyst with expertise in quarterly financial reporting.
TASK: Analyze the attached Q3 2023 financial report for Acme Corporation.
FOCUS AREAS:
1. Revenue changes compared to Q2 2023 and Q3 2022
2. Major shifts in expense categories
3. Changes in profit margin
4. Unusual items or one-time events affecting results
5. Cash flow status and trends

FORMAT: Structure your analysis with clear headings, bullet points for key metrics, and a brief executive summary at the beginning. Include a "Key Concerns" and "Opportunities" section.

CONSTRAINTS: Focus only on factual information from the report. Avoid speculation about future performance unless explicitly mentioned in the outlook section of the report.
```

**Outcome**: The refined prompt produced a structured analysis with consistent formatting, focused on the most business-critical information, and highlighted actionable insights that the initial prompt missed.

### Case Study 2: Customer Support Automation

**Business Challenge**: Improve accuracy and helpfulness of an AI customer support system.

**RAG Implementation**:

    # Retrieve relevant support policies
    policy_docs = policy_retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
    
    # Format all context
    context = format_documents(product_docs, policy_docs)
    
    # Add customer context if available
    if customer_context:
        context += f"\nCUSTOMER CONTEXT:\n{customer_context}"
    
    prompt = f"""
    ROLE: You are a helpful, accurate customer support assistant for Acme Corporation.

    2. If you need more information from the customer, ask clear questions
    3. For technical issues beyond basic troubleshooting, offer to connect with a human agent
    4. Always maintain a friendly, helpful tone
    5. Format your response with proper spacing and organization
    6. If you mention a policy, explain it in simple terms
    
    Your response:
    """
    
    return generate_response(prompt)
```

**Outcome**: The system reduced escalations to human agents by 37%, improved customer satisfaction scores, and maintained 96% factual accuracy based on human evaluation.

## Evaluation Methods (Expanded)

### Automatic Evaluation Frameworks

```python
def evaluate_prompt_effectiveness(prompt_variants, test_cases):
    """
    Systematically evaluate prompt variants against test cases.
    """
    results = {}
    
    for variant_name, prompt_template in prompt_variants.items():
        variant_results = []
        
        for test_case in test_cases:
            # Fill in the prompt template with test case
            filled_prompt = prompt_template.format(**test_case)
            
            # Generate model response
            response = generate_model_response(filled_prompt)
            
            # Apply evaluation metrics
            metrics = calculate_metrics(response, test_case["expected_output"])
            
            variant_results.append({
                "test_case": test_case["name"],
                "metrics": metrics,
                "response": response
            })
        
        # Aggregate results for this variant
        results[variant_name] = {
            "individual_results": variant_results,
            "average_metrics": calculate_average_metrics(variant_results)
        }
    
    # Determine best performing variant
    best_variant = find_best_variant(results)
    
    return {
        "detailed_results": results,
        "best_variant": best_variant,
        "comparison_chart": generate_comparison_chart(results)
    }
```

### Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation

For subjective quality assessment:

1. **Expert Review Process**:
   - Define clear evaluation criteria 
   - Create standardized rating scales
   - Use blind testing (reviewers don't know which prompt generated which output)
   - Calculate inter-rater reliability

2. **A/B Testing Framework**:
   ```
   [User sees either output A or B]
   
   QUESTION: How helpful was this response?
   SCALE: 1 (Not helpful) to 5 (Extremely helpful)
   
   FOLLOW-UP: What would make this response more useful?
   [Free text field]
   ```

3. **Progressive User Testing**:
   - Start with internal testers familiar with the domain
   - Expand to representative user samples
   - Implement wider production A/B testing with metrics tracking
