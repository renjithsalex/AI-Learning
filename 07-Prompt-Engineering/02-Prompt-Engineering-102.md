## Introduction

Prompt engineering is the art and science of effectively communicating with Large Language Models (LLMs) to obtain desired outputs. As AI technologies advance, the ability to craft precise, effective prompts has become a crucial skill for developers, researchers, and AI practitioners.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of prompt engineering techniques, from basic concepts to advanced strategies, drawing on insights from the Google Gen AI Intensive course and industry best practices.

## Fundamental Concepts

### What Makes a Good Prompt?

A well-crafted prompt should be:

- **Clear and specific**: Define exactly what you want
- **Contextually rich**: Provide necessary background information
- **Properly structured**: Organize information in a logical flow
- **Appropriately constrained**: Set boundaries for the response
- **Iteratively refined**: Improved through experimentation

### The Anatomy of Effective Prompts

```
ROLE: You are an expert in [specific domain]
TASK: Your job is to [specific task]
FORMAT: Please structure your response as [desired format]
CONSTRAINTS: Limit your answer to [specific constraints]
CONTEXT: Consider the following information: [relevant context]
QUERY: [Specific question or request]
```

## Prompt Design Patterns

### Zero-Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompts describe requests directly without examples:

```python
prompt = """When I was 4 years old, my partner was 3 times my age. Now,
I am 20 years old. How old is my partner? Let's think step by step."""

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    contents=prompt)
```

### Few-Shot Learning with Examples

Provide examples to guide the model:

```python
prompt = """
Classify the sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative:

Text: "The service was terrible and the food was cold."
Sentiment: Negative

Text: "I enjoyed the movie, but the popcorn was stale."
Sentiment: Mixed

Text: "The concert was absolutely phenomenal!"
Sentiment: 
"""
```

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Guide the model to show its reasoning process:

```python
prompt = """
Solve the following problem step-by-step:
If a train travels 120 km in 1.5 hours, what is its average speed in km/h?
"""
```

## Structured Output Generation

### JSON Response Formatting

```python
structured_output_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(
    response_mime_type="application/json",
    response_schema=SummaryRating,
)
response = chat.send_message(
    message="Convert the final score.",
    config=structured_output_config,
)
structured_eval = response.parsed
```

### Table Generation

```python
prompt = """
Create a comparison table between PyTorch and TensorFlow with the following criteria:
- Learning curve
- Production deployment
- Community support
- Debugging ease
- Mobile deployment
Format as a markdown table.
"""
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Context Window Management

Optimize the use of token context with strategic information placement:

1. **Critical information first**: Place the most important details at the beginning
2. **Relevant context only**: Include only what's necessary for the task
3. **Strategic truncation**: When dealing with large documents, use summarization or chunking

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG combines the power of retrieval systems with generative models:

```python
def get_rag_response(query, n_results=2):
    """
    Implement RAG to answer customer support queries:
    1. Retrieve relevant documents
    2. Combine with the query to create a prompt
    3. Generate a response using Gemini
    """
    # Convert query to embedding and find similar documents
    relevant_docs = db.similarity_search(query, k=n_results)
    
    # Format context from retrieved documents
    context = "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in relevant_docs])
    
    # Create prompt with query and context
    prompt = f"""
    Answer the following question based on the provided context.
    If you cannot answer from the context, say "I don't have enough information."
    
    CONTEXT:
    {context}
    
    QUESTION:
    {query}
    """
    
    # Generate response
    response = gemini_model.generate_content(prompt)
    return response.text
```

### Model Temperature Control

Temperature affects output randomness and creativity:

```python
# Creative, more diverse responses
creative_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(temperature=0.9)

# Precise, deterministic responses 
precise_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(temperature=0.1)

# Completely deterministic
greedy_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(temperature=0.0)
```

## Evaluation Methods

### Rubric-Based Assessment

```python
class SummaryRating(enum.Enum):
  VERY_GOOD = '5'
  GOOD = '4'
  OK = '3'
  BAD = '2'
  VERY_BAD = '1'

def eval_summary(prompt, ai_response):
  """Evaluate the generated summary against the prompt used."""
  chat = client.chats.create(model='gemini-2.0-flash')

  # Generate the full text response
  response = chat.send_message(
      message=SUMMARY_PROMPT.format(prompt=prompt, response=ai_response)
  )
  verbose_eval = response.text

  # Get structured evaluation
  structured_output_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(
      response_mime_type="application/json",
      response_schema=SummaryRating,
  )
  response = chat.send_message(
      message="Convert the final score.",
      config=structured_output_config,
  )
  structured_eval = response.parsed

  return verbose_eval, structured_eval
```

### Comparative Evaluation

Compare outputs from different prompts to determine effectiveness:

```python
def compare_prompts(prompt_a, prompt_b, test_questions):
    """Compare the effectiveness of two different prompts."""
    results = []
    
    for question in test_questions:
        response_a = generate_response(prompt_a, question)
        response_b = generate_response(prompt_b, question)
        
        # Use an LLM to evaluate which response is better
        evaluation = evaluate_responses(question, response_a, response_b)
        results.append(evaluation)
    
    # Analyze the comparison results
    return analyze_results(results)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple and Iterate

Begin with straightforward prompts and refine based on outputs:

```
Initial: "Write about climate change."
Refined: "Write a 300-word explanation of how climate change affects marine ecosystems, focusing on coral reefs and using accessible language for high school students."
```

### 2. Use System and User Roles

```python
system_prompt = "You are an expert science communicator who specializes in explaining complex topics to children ages 8-12."
user_prompt = "Explain how vaccines work."
```

### 3. Include Format Instructions

```
FORMAT: Your response should be structured as follows:
1. A simple definition (1-2 sentences)
2. Three key points (1 paragraph each)
3. A real-world example
4. A brief conclusion
```

### 4. Provide Clear Evaluation Criteria

```
EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Scientific accuracy: All information must be factually correct
- Age-appropriate language: Use vocabulary suitable for 8-12 year olds
- Engagement: Include at least one analogy and one question to maintain interest
- Completeness: Cover how vaccines train the immune system
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Code Generation

```python
code_prompt = """
Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number. No explanation, provide only the code.
"""

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    contents=code_prompt)
```

Output:
```python
def factorial(n):
  """Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer."""
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return n * factorial(n-1)
```

### Example 2: Data Analysis Prompt

```python
analysis_prompt = """
I have data on medal counts for the 2024 Olympics. Generate Python code using seaborn to create a visualization that shows:
1. The top 10 countries by total medal count
2. A breakdown of gold, silver, and bronze medals for each country
3. Clear labels and a title explaining the chart's purpose
"""
```

### Example 3: Implementing RAG for Customer Support

```python
def build_rag_chatbot():
    """
    Implement a RAG-based customer support chatbot that:
    1. Indexes product documentation
    2. Retrieves relevant information based on customer queries
    3. Generates helpful, accurate responses with source attribution
    """
    # Index product documentation
    documents = load_documents("product_docs/")
    chunks = split_documents(documents)
    embeddings = embed_chunks(chunks)
    db = create_vector_store(embeddings)
    
    # Define query processing function
    def answer_query(query):
        relevant_docs = db.similarity_search(query, k=2)
        context = format_context(relevant_docs)
        
        prompt = f"""
        You are a helpful customer support assistant.
        Answer the following question based ONLY on the provided context.
        If you cannot answer from the context, politely explain you don't have that information.
        Always maintain a professional, helpful tone.
        
        CONTEXT:
        {context}
        
        QUESTION:
        {query}
        """
        
        response = generate_response(prompt)
        return response, relevant_docs
    
    return answer_query
```
